The country is divided up into six [[States of Australia|states]] and two territories, and more than half of Australia\\'s [[population]] lives in and around the cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]].\\n\\nAustralia is known for its [[mining]](coal, iron, gold, diamonds and crystals), its production of [[wool]], and as the world\\'s largest producer of [[bauxite]].<ref></ref> Its [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle.\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]\\n\\nAustralia\\'s landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian plate]].<ref></ref>\\nThe continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].\\n\\nPeople first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].\\n\\nMost of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.\\n\\n=== Regions and cities ===\\n\\n\\nAustralia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].<ref></ref> The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).\\n\\nIn 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation\\'s capital. The largest city is Sydney.<ref></ref>\\n\\nAustralia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].\\n\\n== History ==\\n=== Aboriginal people ===\\n[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]\\n\\nThe [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.<ref>Hesp, Patrick A. \\'\\'et al\\'\\' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. \\'\\'Australian Archaeology\\'\\', No 49 (1999)</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.\\n\\nAboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]. The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.\\n\\nThe Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.\\n\\n=== Terra Australis ===\\nIn the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen\\'s Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.\\n\\nThe [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, \\'\\'[[HMS Endeavour]]\\'\\', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook\\'s secret mission was to find \"[[Terra Australis]]\" (the Land of the South).\\n\\nThe voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.\\n\\nCaptain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.\\n\\n=== Settlement ===\\n[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]\\n\\nIn the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England\\'s convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\\n\\nBy the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\\n\\nCaptain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was \"the finest harbor in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.\\n\\nFor the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.\\n\\nSomehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen\\'s Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.\\n\\nWhile the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.\\n\\n=== Exploration ===\\n[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]\\n\\nBecause Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.\\nWhen the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&nbsp;miles from Sydney.\\n\\nSome people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.\\n\\n===Self government===\\n\\nThe gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.\\n\\nThe transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia\\'s first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.<ref name=\"aec.gov.au\"></ref><ref>[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] </ref>\\n\\nAustralians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.\\n\\n=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===\\n[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting of the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]], 9 May 1901, painted by [[Tom Roberts]].

Retrieved 9 December 2007.</ref>]]\\n\\nUntil 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the [[British Empire]], and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.\\n\\nIn Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.<ref>[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]</ref>\\n\\nIn 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.\\n\\nAustralia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.\\n\\nWhen the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].\\n\\nIn the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, than Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.\\n\\nIn 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].\\n\\nIn the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.\\n\\nToday Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.<ref>[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]</ref>\\n\\n[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.\\n\\n== Politics ==\\n[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]\\n\\nAustralia is made up of six [[state]]s, and two mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]].

The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]].\\n\\nThe [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Scott Morrison]].\\n\\nThe leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently [[His Excellency]] [[David Hurley]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n[[File:Sydney Opera House Night.jpg|thumb|<center>The [[Sydney Opera House]] was officially opened in 1973.</center>]]\\n\\nAustralia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]],<ref></ref> but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.\\n\\nFamous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.\\n\\n[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|[[didgeridoo]]]]\\n\\nAustralian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (\\'\\'Dame Edna Everage\\'\\'), [[Steve Irwin]] (\\'\\'The Crocodile Hunter\\'\\') and [[The Wiggles]]. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as [[Bogan Hunters]] and [[Kath & Kim]].<ref></ref>\\n\\nAustralia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, \\'\\'[[The Australian]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[The Australian Financial Review]]\\'\\'.\\n\\n[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history.

Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 [[Commonwealth Games]] and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the [[Australian Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]]. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.\\n\\nThe main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].\\nFor women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].\\n\\nFamous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].\\n\\n=== Art festivals ===\\n\\nJust 60 years ago, Australia had only one big art festival.

Its [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle.\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]\\n\\nAustralia\\'s landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian plate]].\\nThe continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].\\n\\nPeople first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].\\n\\nMost of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.\\n\\n=== Regions and cities ===\\n\\n\\nAustralia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]]. The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).\\n\\nIn 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation\\'s capital. The largest city is Sydney.\\n\\nAustralia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].\\n\\n== History ==\\n=== Aboriginal people ===\\n[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]\\n\\nThe [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.Hesp, Patrick A. \\'\\'et al\\'\\' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. \\'\\'Australian Archaeology\\'\\', No 49 (1999) Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.\\n\\nAboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]. The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.\\n\\nThe Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.\\n\\n=== Terra Australis ===\\nIn the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen\\'s Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.\\n\\nThe [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, \\'\\'[[HMS Endeavour]]\\'\\', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook\\'s secret mission was to find \"[[Terra Australis]]\" (the Land of the South).\\n\\nThe voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.\\n\\nCaptain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.\\n\\n=== Settlement ===\\n[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]\\n\\nIn the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England\\'s convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\\n\\nBy the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\\n\\nCaptain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was \"the finest harbor in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.\\n\\nFor the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.\\n\\nSomehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen\\'s Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.\\n\\nWhile the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.\\n\\n=== Exploration ===\\n[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]\\n\\nBecause Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.\\nWhen the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100\\xa0miles from Sydney.\\n\\nSome people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.\\n\\n===Self government===\\n\\nThe gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.\\n\\nThe transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia\\'s first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] \\n\\nAustralians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.\\n\\n=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===\\n[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting of the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]], 9 May 1901, painted by [[Tom Roberts]].

Retrieved 9 December 2007.]]\\n\\nUntil 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the [[British Empire]], and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.\\n\\nIn Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]\\n\\nIn 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.\\n\\nAustralia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.\\n\\nWhen the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].\\n\\nIn the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, than Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.\\n\\nIn 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].\\n\\nIn the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.\\n\\nToday Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]\\n\\n[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.\\n\\n== Politics ==\\n[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]\\n\\nAustralia is made up of six [[state]]s, and two mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]].

English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.\\n\\nFamous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.\\n\\n[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|[[didgeridoo]]]]\\n\\nAustralian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (\\'\\'Dame Edna Everage\\'\\'), [[Steve Irwin]] (\\'\\'The Crocodile Hunter\\'\\') and [[The Wiggles]]. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as [[Bogan Hunters]] and [[Kath & Kim]].\\n\\nAustralia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations.

Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 [[Commonwealth Games]] and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the [[Australian Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]]. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.\\n\\nThe main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].\\nFor women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].\\n\\nFamous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].\\n\\n=== Art festivals ===\\n\\nJust 60 years ago, Australia had only one big art festival.

They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{cn}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.\n",

      "Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{cn}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.\n",

      "In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia.

      "The [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find \"[[Terra Australis]]\" (the Land of the South).\n",

      "The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land.

      "\n",
      "In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was \"the finest harbor in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.\n",

      "Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.\n",
      "When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&nbsp;miles from Sydney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.\n",

      "The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]].

Because of this, many  and  live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the , the , the , the , and the .\\n\\nPeople first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the s. For the history of Australia, see .\\n\\nMost of the Australian colonies, having been settled from , became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901.

Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable  (not too hot) for many s and .\\n\\n== History ==\\n=== Aboriginal people ===\\n\\n\\nThe  people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.Hesp, Patrick A. \\'\\'et al\\'\\' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. \\'\\'Australian Archaeology\\'\\', No 49 (1999) Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the  where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.\\n\\nAboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in  and . The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The  was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.\\n\\nThe Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.\\n\\n=== Terra Australis ===\\nIn the 1600s,  merchants traded with the islands of  (now ), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent  on a voyage of discovery and he found , which he named . Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.\\n\\nThe  was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain  to the . His ship, \\'\\'\\'\\', carried the famous scientists, Sir  and Dr Solander who were going to  where they would watch the planet  pass in front of the . Captain Cook\\'s secret mission was to find \"\" (the Land of the South).\\n\\nThe voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found  and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the . Captain Cook named that bit of land . They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.\\n\\nCaptain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.\\n\\n=== Settlement ===\\n\\n\\nIn the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and s (s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England\\'s convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.\\n\\nBy the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the  of eleven ships set sail from  carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain . They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.\\n\\nCaptain Phillip found that  was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was \"the finest harbor in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of  of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.\\n\\nFor the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.\\n\\nSomehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to  and to  (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.\\n\\nWhile the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.\\n\\n=== Exploration ===\\n\\n\\nBecause Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.\\nWhen the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the . They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 ,  and a 17-year-old called  crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor,  founded the town of  on the other side, 100\\xa0miles from Sydney.\\n\\nSome people, like Captain  were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills.  got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major  was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The  had come from , had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.\\n\\n===Self government===\\n\\nThe gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.\\n\\nThe transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy.  started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia\\'s first political party) in 1835 to demand .

After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.\\n\\nWhen the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work.

Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like ) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else.

''Australian Archaeology'', No 49 (1999) Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people.
